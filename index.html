    <p> <i>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of
            Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players
            are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have
            unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging
            through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one
            or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game
            economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is
            responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary
            guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper
            rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to
            be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.</i></p>

    <h1><u>Agents</u></h1>
    <p><b><u>Duelist</b></u></p>
    <p>Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists
        is "self-sufficient fraggers."Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving
        their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which
        blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other
        agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard
        and get impact frags.

        On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in
        front of everyone to get opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage
        when gunfighting an enemy.

        On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their
        kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.

        Duelists include Jett, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Yoru, and Neon</p>

    <p><b><u>Initiator</b></u></p>
    <p>Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions.
        Initiators' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This
        information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier.

        On defense, initiators can use their abilities to provide information on where the attackers are going, as well
        as helping their teammates retake a lost site.

        Initiators include Breach, KAY/O, Skye, Sova, and Fade</p>

    <p><b><u>Sentinel</b></u></p>
    <p>Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies.
        Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the
        team valuable information and/or deal damage.

        On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can
        ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed.

        On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering a site. This provides valuable time
        for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support.

        Sentinels include Chamber, Cypher, Killjoy, and Sage</p>

    <p><b><u>Controller</b></u></p>
    <p>Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."[25] They use their
        abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control.

        To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities consist of some kind of smoke, as well as
        molotovs, stuns, or flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer
        to move through the map without getting seen.

        On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd control on common defensive spots
        to force enemies into the open.

        On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team
        from moving forward.

        Controllers include Astra, Brimstone, Omen, and Viper</p>
